Features of JSON Server
Here are some of the features of JSON Server:

It is easy and quick to set up. It is also user-friendly for front-end developers and newbie back-end developers.
It supports common HTTP methods like the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, just like a real backend API server would.
With JSON Server, you can perform Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations on data to build an interactive application.
JSON Server offers developers the ability to create custom routes to handle more complex scenarios.

GET /users - This retrieves a list of all resource entities of users.
GET /users/:id - This retrieves a specific user by its id.
POST /users - This creates a new user.
PUT /users/:id - This updates a user based on a specified id.
DELETE /users/:id - This deletes a user based on the specified id.
